Build a web-based Ulendo Reservation System for a lodge with 30 rooms using Django (Python) and SQLite as the database.

The system is for internal use by reception staff to manage room bookings and availability by date range.

Core Requirements:

Manage 30 rooms (room number, optional room type).

Create reservations by assigning available rooms for selected check-in and check-out dates.

Prevent double-booking for overlapping date ranges.

Two booking flows:

Voucher upload with OCR extraction of: customer name, voucher number, check-in date, check-out date.

Manual booking with the same fields (no voucher upload).

OCR results must be editable and reviewable before confirmation.

Show only rooms available for the selected date range when allocating a room.

Store all data in the system’s own SQLite database.

Reporting:

Daily check-ins

Daily check-outs

Occupancy rate

Monthly summary report

Ability to export reports to PDF or Excel

UI / UX Requirements:

Modern, clean, professional web interface.

Card-based dashboard layout.

Room availability grid or calendar view.

Status badges for rooms (Available, Booked, Selected).

Branding / Colors (Ulendo Brand):

Primary (buttons, highlights): #C77A1A (gold/bronze)

Secondary (sidebar, headers): #0F0F0F (charcoal)

Background: #F7F7F7

Text primary: #111111

Success: #1E9E5A

Warning: #F4A261

Error: #D64545

Info: #2F80ED

Technical Guidelines:

Use Django best practices (apps for rooms, reservations, vouchers, reports).

Use Django ORM for all database operations.

Implement proper date overlap logic to prevent double-booking.

Design the code so the database can later be migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL without changing business logic.

Voucher OCR can use Tesseract or equivalent Python OCR library.

Provide clean separation between backend logic, database models, and frontend templates.

Screens to Implement:

Dashboard (rooms available today, check-ins, check-outs, occupancy)

New Reservation (voucher upload + manual form)

Room Availability (filter by date range)

Reservations List (search by name, voucher number, date)

Reports (daily, monthly, exportable)

The system should be production-usable for a real lodge reception desk, not just a demo CRUD app.
